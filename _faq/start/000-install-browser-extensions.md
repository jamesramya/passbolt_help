3.  Click on the "Add to Firefox" button
4.  Wait until the add-on download is complete
5.  Click install
6.  A passbolt icon should now be visible

### I did this, but it still does not work!

Sometimes Firefox does not behave as expected and passbolt will not start. We are aware of the problem and are trying to fix it. In the meantime here is what you try:

*   Press F5 / refresh the page.
*   Close firefox and restart it again.
*   Remove the firefox extension and reinstall it again.

If you are still experiencing issues after trying these options out, feel free to get in touch, we would be happy to know more.

### How to remove the Firefox extension

{% include articles/video.html
    url="/assets/files/an_remove_plugin_firefox_864.mp4"
    mime_type="video/mp4"
    legend="Passbolt Browser Extension - Remove on Firefox"
    width="500px"
%}

Clicking on "remove from toolbar" will only hide passbolt icon and not remove it!

1.  Open firefox
2.  Click on the menu icon on the top right
3.  Click on Add-ons
4.  You should see passbolt in the list
5.  Click on the remove button
