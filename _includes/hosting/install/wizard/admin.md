## 3. Configure your administrator account

### 3.1. Download the plugin

Before continuing passbolt will require you to download its plugin. If you already have it installed you can go to the
next step.

### 3.2. Create a new key

Passbolt will ask you to create or import a key that will be later use to identify you and encrypt your passwords.
Your key needs to be protected by a password. Choose it wisely, it will be the gatekeeper to all your other passwords.

### 3.3. Download your recovery kit

This step is essential. Your key is the only way to access your account and passwords. 

{% include messages/warning.html
content="**WARNING:** If you lose this key (by breaking or losing your computer and not having a backup for example), your encrypted data will be lost even if you remember your passphrase."
%}

### 3.4. Define your security token

Choosing a color and a three characters token is a secondary security mechanism that helps you to mitigate phishing
attacks. Each time you are performing a sensitive operation on passbolt, you should see this token.
