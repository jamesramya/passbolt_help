## Code of conduct

This Code of Conduct applies to all of us: Passbolt staff, contributors, maintainers and participants in any campaigns, projects, and communities under the Passbolt name.

We expect this Code of Conduct to be followed in any ticketing system, social network, forum, mailing list, IRC channel, wiki, web site, private correspondence, online and offline event or meeting.

## Gender policy

Passbolt is committed to creating a community that is safe, welcoming, and inclusive for everyone, regardless of gender or gender identity. We recognize that gender-based discrimination, harassment, and prejudice can have a negative impact on individuals and the community as a whole, and we strive to prevent such behavior.

### Inclusion and Diversity

We value diversity and recognize the importance of having a community that reflects a variety of perspectives and experiences. We are committed to creating an environment that welcomes and embraces individuals of all genders, including those who identify as non-binary, genderqueer, or transgender. We actively encourage the participation of individuals of all genders in our community.

### Anti-Discrimination

We do not tolerate discrimination based on gender, gender identity or expression, or any other characteristic protected by applicable law. We will not accept any form of derogatory remarks, images, or exclusion from activities or opportunities.

### Accommodations

We strive to create an environment that is accessible and accommodating to all individuals, regardless of gender or gender identity. We will work with individuals to ensure that they have access to the resources and accommodations they need to participate fully in our community.

## Anti-harassment policy

We pledge to respect everyone who contributes to this project in any way.

We welcome contributions from everyone regardless of geographical location, age, culture, ethnicity, gender, gender-identity, language, disability, physical appearance, sexual orientation and religious views.

We do not tolerate harassment of participants in any form. Personal attacks, hate speech, trolling, baiting, spamming, any intentional form of discrimination, unwelcome sexual attention or imagery, deliberate intimidation, physical threats, stalking or any other kind of bad behaviour will be dealt with decisively.

Offenders will be temporarily or permanently banned from communicating through Passbolt's systems and events or otherwise penalised. These rules may be enforced at the discretion of Passbolt staff by removing issues, comments, blocking or reporting accounts and banning from online or public meetings. 

## Interaction principles

We pledge to adhere to following principles when interacting with each other:

**Be respectful**: there will always be people with whom we may disagree or find it difficult to cooperate. We will, however, take a deep breath if we need to and then remain respectful.


**Agree to disagree**: decisions are often a difficult choice between competing priorities and there are many ways of reaching our common goals. If we disagree, we will do so politely.


**Assume good faith**: when we disagree we do not assume the worst, it is unlikely a participant is intentionally trying to degrade the quality of a discussion or product. We will assume best intentions in our interactions.


**Welcome other perspectives**: we actively seek to be open to ideas that make our own ideas better. We empower others to speak and will strive to make diversity and inclusion intentional. We welcome contributions from everyone as long as they interact constructively with our community.


**Be concise**: we try to be concise and avoid repeating what has already been said. We try to stay on topic, especially in discussions that are already fairly large.


**Be transparent**: we are open about what we are working on to allow others to participate. We are also transparent about our mistakes to allow others to
learn and avoid repeating them.
