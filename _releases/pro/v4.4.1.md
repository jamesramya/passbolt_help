Passbolt v4.4.1 is a maintenance release aimed at addressing issues reported by the community, which were introduced in the previous release.

The update addresses an issue concerning user roles in email notifications. Previously, administrators received notifications when another administrator was deleted. However, the deletion of any user, regardless of their administrator status, was incorrectly reported as an administrator deletion. This issue has been resolved.

Moreover, the release also fixes a critical issue encountered by administrators attempting to configure Single Sign-On (SSO) with Microsoft Azure AD (also referred to as Microsoft Entra). This regression was introduced in version 4.4.0 as part of the new OpenID provider support. Also the user synchronisation via active directory for users with very long names is now fixed.

We extend our gratitude to the community members who reported these issues. Your support and patience are greatly appreciated.
