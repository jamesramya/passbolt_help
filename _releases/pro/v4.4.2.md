Passbolt version 4.4.2 has been released, primarily as a maintenance update to address specific issues reported by users. 
This version includes two main fixes.

The first fix concerns the Time-based One-Time Password (TOTP) feature. In the previous version, there was an issue where 
users could accidentally delete the TOTP secret for a resource while editing its description from the sidebar. This has 
been corrected in the latest update.

The second fix improves the performance of the application, specifically when users are retrieving their resources. 
This update is part of an ongoing effort to enhance the overall performance of the application, with further 
improvements planned for future releases.

We extend our gratitude to [@EmnichtdaYT](https://github.com/passbolt/passbolt_docker/issues/219) who reported this issue.
