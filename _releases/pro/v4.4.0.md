Version 4.4 of Passbolt Pro is now available, packed full of improvements and new functionalities.

With this release, users are able to manage TOTPs directly from the browser, providing an extended TOTP experience
across all their devices. They can now be created, deleted, organised and shared with others just like any other
resource type.

Another highlight of this release, administrators now have the ability to suspend/unsuspend users. This new
feature will offer administrators with more control over access management of their instance. By example,
they will be able to prevent access to the passbolt instance for users in temporary leave, therefore enforce
company policies.

This update also introduces an additional option for SSO: a generic OAuth 2.0 provider is now available, 
expanding your authentication options and providing even more versatility. Another highlight of this update 
is improved notifications, so you can effortlessly stay in the know. Admins now have the ability to suspend and 
unsuspend users with ease.

But it's not all about major features; this version also includes a number of other improvements and fixes to make 
your passbolt experience smoother and more efficient.

If youâ€™re a system operator, please note that using older PHP versions will now trigger a healthcheck warning. 
Support for PHP 7.4 and 8.0 will be discontinued soon. Admins are encouraged to upgrade to PHP 8.1 or higher and 
use the latest version of the passbolt API.

Upgrade to version 4.4 to take advantage of these improvements. Thank you for using and supporting passbolt!
