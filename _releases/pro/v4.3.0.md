The latest version of Pro is here – take a look at what’s new in 4.3.

One enhancement is improved portability of TOTP (Time Based One Time Password). TOTP can now be conveniently viewed across both the web and mobile applications. Although the creation of TOTP remains mobile-centric, version 4.3 provides convenient access to reading and retrieving TOTP content in the browser, resulting in greater usability.

Improvements have also been made to grid customisation. Any changes made to the grid are now persistent, meaning your tailored experience is saved from session to session. And to make the new TOTP portability even more accessible, an option has been added to display a column for your TOTP content.

Admins can now manage passphrase policies alongside their password policies. These policies include: setting minimal entropy, managing access to external tools for monitoring if a passphrase has been compromised, and choosing to enforce policies for existing users.

Other updates include improvements to SQL query performance (retrieving resource tags and system tags), restricting LDAP-related settings, some bug fixes, and a number of performance improvements.

Thank you for choosing passbolt and for your continued support.
