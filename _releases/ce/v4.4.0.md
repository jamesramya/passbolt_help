Version 4.4 of the Community Edition has launched with new capabilities and improvements.

With this release, users are able to manage TOTPs directly from the browser, providing an extended TOTP experience 
across all their devices. They can now be created, deleted, organised and shared with others just like any other 
resource type.

Another highlight of this release, administrators now have the ability to suspend/unsuspend users. This new 
feature will offer administrators with more control over access management of their instance. By example, 
they will be able to prevent access to the passbolt instance for users in temporary leave, therefore enforce 
company policies.

And that's not all – a number of fixes and enhancements have been implemented to improve user experience. 
Among them, notification emails are now aggregated in certain cases, including limiting emails when a user imports 
a large amount of passwords.

If you’re a system operator, please note that using older PHP versions will now trigger a healthcheck warning. 
Support for PHP 7.4 and 8.0 will be discontinued soon. Admins are encouraged to upgrade to PHP 8.1 or higher 
and use the latest version of the passbolt API.

Get the most out of passbolt – upgrade to version 4.4. Thanks for continuing to support passbolt and for being 
part of the community!
