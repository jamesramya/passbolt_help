Introducing the newest release of passbolt – get to know version 4.3

This update extends the portability of TOTP (Time Based One Time Password) content. You can now access TOTP items from passbolt’s mobile app and web interface. While the ability to create a TOTP is still limited to mobile, this update lets you view them through the browser, adding to its flexibility and usability.

Improvements have also been made to the customisation of the grid in the password workspace. This update makes edits to the grid persistent, meaning that changes will now be saved between sessions. To further improve overall usability, an optional column for TOTP has also been added.

Thank you for using passbolt, for contributing to the vision, and your feedback.
